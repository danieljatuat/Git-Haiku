Hello World!
Cherry blossoms bloom,
Soft petals dance in the breeze,
Spring's sweet melody.
the first cold shower
even the monkey seems to want
a little coat of straw
Winter's icy grip,
Frosty breath and snowflakes dance,
Peaceful solitude.
Autumn leaves falling,
Colors of gold and crimson,
Nature's symphony.
Goodbye world!
